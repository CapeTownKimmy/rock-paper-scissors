# rock-paper-scissors

In this introductory JavaScript project, I will be creating the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".
Further styling will be added later as the initial build will consist of mainly JavaScript.

This is my first solo attempt at writing a fully functioning programme and I did struggle and I am very aware that my code is not in anyway 'clean'. However as I learn I will improve so please forgive them mess!

Thanks.
